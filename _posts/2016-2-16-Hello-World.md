Â¡Bienvenido!

I'm excited to start blogging again, now as a Data Scientist, on this blog: AlexThompson.ai .  I've been transitioning to data science over the last 14 months, and it is time to get a bit more public about it.  I hope that writing about my projects will help me to get good feedback, and add a little motivation to be that much more consistent.  Writing about a topic has often helped me to improve my understanding of it, and I hope that will be true here as well.

Please comment away, as you see fit, when I post substantative posts in the future.

Creating this blog was super easy, thanks to GitHub Pages and Jekyll.  If you're interested in following a similar path, I followed Barry Clarks' tutorial: [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/){:target="_blank"}.

## Testing out Mathjax integration:

\\(\eta \ p(z_t \ | \ x_t) \int_{x_{t-1}} p(x_t \ | \ x_{t-1}, u_t) \ bel(x_{t-1}) \ dx_{t-1}\\)

$$\eta \ p(z_t \ | \ x_t) \int_{x_{t-1}} p(x_t \ | \ x_{t-1}, u_t) \ bel(x_{t-1}) \ dx_{t-1}$$

\(\eta \ p(z_t \ | \ x_t) \int_{x_{t-1}} p(x_t \ | \ x_{t-1}, u_t) \ bel(x_{t-1}) \ dx_{t-1}\)

blah blah math $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ blah blah

\\(\require{color} bel(x_t) = \eta \ p(\colorbox{aquamarine}{$\displaystyle z_t$} \ | \ x_t) \int_{x_{t-1}} p(x_t \ | \ x_{t-1}, \colorbox{yellowgreen}{$\displaystyle u_t$}) \ \colorbox{plum}{$\displaystyle bel(x_{t-1}$)} \ dx_{t-1} \\)

$$\require{color} bel(x_t) = \eta \ p(\colorbox{aquamarine}{$\displaystyle z_t$} \ | \ x_t) \int_{x_{t-1}} p(x_t \ | \ x_{t-1}, \colorbox{yellowgreen}{$\displaystyle u_t$}) \ \colorbox{plum}{$\displaystyle bel(x_{t-1}$)} \ dx_{t-1}$$
